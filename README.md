## Backend configuration
In order to run the backend you should go to the `backend` folder and run the following commands:

`npm install`

and then:

`npm start`

By default, the JSON's server will run in the 3000 port. You can easily configure it by changing the `.env` file, the property `PORT`.


## Frontend configuration
To run the frontend you should run the following commands:

`npm install`

and then:

`npm start`

**NOTICE:** _By default, the frontend is configured to point to the API in the port number 3000, if you've changed if for a custom one, you need to configure it manually._
